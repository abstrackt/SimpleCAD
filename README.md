# SimpleCAD

A simple CAD interface written from ground-up in C# using OpenTK and ImGUI.NET. It allows the user to create models using a variety of surfaces and figures.

Currently implemented types of objects are:

- Points
- Quads
- Toruses
- Bezier Curves (C0)
- B-Spline Curves (C2)
- Interpolating Curves (C2)
- Bezier Surfaces (C0)
- B-Spline Surfaces (C2)
- Gregory patches
- Intersection curves

This software was later used to create a model which was milled using a 3-DOF milling machine.
